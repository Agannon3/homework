    I always thought of comics to be the outcast of media forms. <br>
    Looking back on my childhood, It was not surprising to me that <br>
    I was heavily interested in <br>
    superhero comicbooks and BONE! <br>
    My dad would buy me some on fridays <br>
    at a famous NYC comicbook store, <br>

    (I dont know if its there anymore on 34th and 8th????....a victim of Amazon perhaps?). <br>
    One of the things McCloud points out that I like about comics is how we <br>
    use our eyes to interact with the text in a way that is specifically spatial. <br>
    Unlike a book, where dialogue and action is constrained by sequential elements of textual <br>
    writing such as sentences, paragraphs, and quotes. The comic uses images, drawings, and quotes <br>
    to bring traditional static elements of literature to life. <br>

    McCloud calls comics a "mono-sensory medium." <br>
    Despite using one of our senses there is very little that is monolothic <br>
    regarding how a comic may effect us. <br>

    He shows how words like "short" and "long" have first and fourth dimension implications. <br>
    The shapes and sizes used in this medium allow us to experience text <br>
    in far different ways then traditional novels or texts. <br>
    Writing using different fonts, sizes, and script adds a flavor to comics <br>
    that classical traditional novels do not have. <br>
        Yet there is an element of comics and comic readers that makes me <br>
        feel the genre is disrespected or even dismissed by society and academia. <br>

        I remember when my 4th grade teacher said "read real books not comics." <br>
    Imagine how differently The Great Gatsby would be percieved <br>
    if it was a comic. <br>
        Comics are an important part of our communcation history as McCloud <br>
        makes astute connections to Egyptian Hieroglyphs. <br>
        Respect Comics! Welcome the outcast!
