<p>Episode one was my favorite segment.<br>
I believe that people enjoy looking at classical paintings <br>
primarily because they are filled with a world<br>
    that is oversaturated with photos.

Paintings represent a more static and stable society. <br>
    I imagine John Berger
would enjoy the Apesh***t music video. To see Beyonce <br>
    and Jay-Z dancing and rapping in front of
the world's most famous paintings and statues. <br>

    It reflects the need to be seen <br>
    or recognized for that matter among the <br>
    great historical masterpieces. <br>
    I imagine he would see this juxtaposition of mediums and culture <br>
    as an engaging example of creative spirit. <br>

    <q>Art washes away the soul the dust of everyday life.</q>
    -Pablo Picasso <br>
Paintings cannot be altered. <br>
This is special. <br>
There is an element of a museum experience <br>
that embraces the static. In most fine <br>
art museaums you are encouraged to <br>
be quite observe and <br>
reflect upon the artwork you see. <br>
    Patrons must acknowledge that they respect<br>
    others silence and right to enjoy the art.<br>
